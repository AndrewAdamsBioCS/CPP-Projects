Description: A small translation dictionary searchable using BST.
The user enters an English word at the terminal, it is searched for in the dictionary, and if found the translation is printed to the terminal.

The translation dictionary is stored in 'dataFile.txt'; for this project, a small sample of English-to-French translations is used.

This was a class project for CMPT 225 at Simon Fraser University, Summer 2017. The focus of this project was to explore a link-based implementation of the Binary Search Tree (BST) abstract data type. Some starter code (e.g., function declarations without implementation) was provided by course instructor (Anne Lavergne).


To run program, navigate to project folder in terminal and enter command 'make' to create executable 'tApp' using Makefile.

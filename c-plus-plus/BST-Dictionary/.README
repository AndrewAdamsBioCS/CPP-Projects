Description: A small translation dictionary searchable using BST.
The user enters an English word at the terminal, it is searched for in the dictionary, and if found the translation is printed to the terminal.

The translation dictionary is stored in 'dataFile.txt'; for this project, a small sample of English-to-French translations is used.


To run program, navigate to project folder in terminal and enter command 'make' to create executable 'tApp' using Makefile.
